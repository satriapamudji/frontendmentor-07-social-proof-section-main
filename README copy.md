## Overview

[Results Summary Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV)

In this challenge, we had to build out this order summary card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

For this project, I built it with these:

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this challenge, my main focus was to start using rem and move away from the px for spacing. I also focused on trying as little as possible to define any set height or width for components, which was what I did not do properly for the last few challenges as I was focused on getting the layouts right.

I also started out by designing with the mobile view first, followed by touching up on the desktop site. I also tried to make my HTML as semantic as possible, noting that articles should be used when things are self-contained and semantically related, section for only semantically related items, and div for other components.

Last but not least, I spent the most time trying to get the button color to go from a solid color to a gradient, which brought me to this [article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/gradient-transitions-with-css-f7004b89892) about gradient transitions which helped me nail the animation that I wanted.

I also tried to implement fluid types using [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/), and also used the converter for px to rem using this [converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter).

In my next challenge, I want to continue using this methodology, and hopefully be able to not set height and width for all (not sure if that is the right way to go about doing things though).
